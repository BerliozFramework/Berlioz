## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-19

The version 3.0.0 marks the transition of the Berlioz Framework to a **Monorepo** structure.

Why this move?

- **Consistency:** Ensures all Berlioz components are tested and released together, preventing version mismatches.
- **Maintenance:** Simplifies the management of issues and pull requests by centralizing them in one place.
- **Better CI/CD:** Global testing ensures that a change in one package never breaks another.
