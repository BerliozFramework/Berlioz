# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `FormMapping(get:, set:)` strategy accepted as the `mapped` option, allowing full control over how an
  element reads from and writes to the mapped object (arbitrary internal target, nested properties, on-the-fly
  transformations). The public `name` stays decoupled from the internal mapping target.
- `ElementInterface::getMapping(): ?FormMapping` normalizing the `mapped` option (`false`/`string`/`true`/
  `FormMapping`) into a single strategy.

### Changed

- Mapping is now resolved uniformly through `FormMapping`. As a consequence, `mapped: false` also disables
  collection (previously only hydration was skipped), making collect and hydrate consistent.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Enforce `max_elements` limits consistently in `Collection::setValue()` and `Collection::submitValue()`
- Avoid duplicate `[]` suffix in multiple file input names rendered by Twig
- Fix enum array transformation by converting each submitted value independently in `EnumTransformer::fromForm()`
- Rewind uploaded file stream after reading magic bytes in `FileFormatValidator::validate()` to prevent downstream code from missing the beginning of the stream

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-19

The version 3.0.0 marks the transition of the Berlioz Framework to a **Monorepo** structure.

Why this move?

- **Consistency:** Ensures all Berlioz components are tested and released together, preventing version mismatches.
- **Maintenance:** Simplifies the management of issues and pull requests by centralizing them in one place.
- **Better CI/CD:** Global testing ensures that a change in one package never breaks another.
